we can see that there are many factors that affect the housing prices very much both in positive and negative manner.
* Factors such as Overall Grade which rates a house if it is good or bad or excellent or okay, Flat Area(in sqft), and lattitude which means that houses at north east regions will cost higher than other houses(US housing prices data set used).
